Prework Week 3 assignment
=========================

This week you'll be completing the scripts in the following files:

* arrayIndexConsiderations.js
* arrays.js
* booleanConditions.js
* doWhileLoops.js
* forLoop.js
* logicalOperators.js
* loopsAndConditions.js
* switchDefault.js
* whileLoop.js

Each script has some code ready for you with comments telling you what to write. For example. let's look at 'example.js':

Originally it would have come to you like this:

```javascript
function tripleThis( number ){
  // this function accepts a number as an argument
  // write code that triples the number given
  // return this new, higher number
} // end tripleThis
```

After doing your work it would look something like the following:

```javascript
function tripleThis( number ){
  // this function accepts a number as an argument
  // write code that triples the number given
  var answer = number * 3;
  // return this new, higher number
  return answer;
} // end tripleThis
```

All the js files are sourced into index.html.

Turn in your work via the assignment app at primeacademy.io, as usual and don't hesitate to hit up the Slack channel as needed!

Don't edit or worry about any files other than the .js files
